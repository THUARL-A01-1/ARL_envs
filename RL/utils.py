    # Note: The harmonic transform is not explicitly calculated here, but rather assumed to be represented by r and beta.

    # Assuming theta is the rotation around the z-axis and phi is the rotation around the y-axis
    # Note: phi is not used in this implementation, as we are only considering rotation around the z-axis.
